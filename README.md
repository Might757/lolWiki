# lolWiki
This project was made using the W3.CSS framework and the AOS library.

All content displayed in the website was taken from the League of Legends official website.

This project was made for a college project, so it only displays the 6 first League of Legends champions.

Each champion has its own page which shows each one's abilities, with the name of the ability, a brief description of the ability, and a video showing the ability.
