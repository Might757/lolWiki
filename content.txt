WHAT IS LEAGUE OF LEGENDS?
League of Legends is a team-based strategy game where two teams of five powerful champions face off to destroy the other’s base.
Choose from over 140 champions to make epic plays, secure kills, and take down towers as you battle your way to victory.

DESTROY THE NEXUS!
The Nexus is the heart of both teams bases. Destroy the enemy’s base first to win the game.

MAKE YOUR CHAMPION THE STRONGEST!
Champions get stronger by earning experience to level up, and gold to buy more powerful items as the game progresses. Killing minion, jungle camps, epic monsters and enemy champions contributes to stay at the top!
